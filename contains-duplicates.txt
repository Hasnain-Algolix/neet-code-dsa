Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true



-- Solution - 1
Time = O(n^2)
Space = O(1)
  We will iterate the array using two for loops, in each iteration we will compare each value with the value of the second iteration. There is a trick in this solution, like in general when we loop the array it will start from the very start of the array, it's ok to start from the start in the first array, but in the second iteration we don't want to start from the first element as we have already selected the first element in the first loop, for base on the first element of the first loop we want to compare with other values in the array, so in the second loop we will start from the second value and compare with the first value of the first loop. To start from the second number we can do something like this in second loop:
  for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++)





-- Solution - 2
Time = O(n log n)
Space = O(1)
  First we will sort the array in asc order, now the each number that is duplicate will come after the same number, like 1 after 1, so in this case we can compare two neighbors together. To compare two numbers we will start from the number one and will create a pointer to first number, and also for second number we need a second pointer to the next number, for this we can do [i + 1], to go one step next. Now we will compare the first and second value if these are equal than we will return true other wise we need to move the pointers to the next two neighbors, and will keep iterating, if not found two numbers than return false outside from the loop.




-- Solution - 3
Time = O(n)
Space = O(n)
  First we need to create an empty hash table, loop the array once, and in each iteration we will check if the number is present in the hash table or not, if yes then return true, becuase we found duplicates. In the second scenario if the number is not present in the hash table than add that number, and keep iterating the array.
